 Digital Health Village – Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Version 1.0 | July 2025

👋 Overview
Digital Health Village is a gamified health and wellness platform that helps individuals and families build healthier habits through daily quests, points, and AI-guided support. Think Duolingo for wellness — but more personal, community-driven, and built with love for all ages.

It’s more than an app. It’s a movement. A place where your whole family can grow healthier, together.

💡 The Big Idea
Health is often sold as an individual responsibility. But in most cultures — especially ours — well-being is communal. The Digital Health Village turns everyday wellness into an adventure you can take with your family, friends, or even your co-workers.

By rewarding small habits (like drinking water or taking a walk), encouraging family participation, and bringing in a touch of AI, we aim to make consistent health accessible, fun, and rewarding.

🎯 Goals
Encourage healthier lifestyles in a fun, interactive way

Build a multi-generational user base: kids, parents, grandparents

Monetize through ads (Ezoic), affiliate links, and potential brand partnerships

Make wellness affordable, relatable, and culturally inclusive

Create a product that investors want to be part of — not just fund

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Target Users
Families looking to improve health together

Young adults and professionals trying to build routines

Elderly users who enjoy gamified challenges with their grandkids

Health-conscious communities and schools

Anyone who enjoys apps like Duolingo, Fitbit, or Headspace — but wants something more community-based and affordable

We need:

Support to scale infrastructure (backend, AI, reward system)

Partnerships with health brands

Marketing and community growth input

Advisors who understand tech and heart

We’re building something that could live in every home. Something lovable, useful, and sticky enough that people won’t want to miss a day. Something investors will be proud to say they helped build.

🙏 Closing Note
We’re grateful you’re considering this journey with us.
Digital Health Village is more than a platform — it’s a space for people to connect, grow, and live better together. One small habit at a time.

Let’s build the future of community health — beautifully.
